# Student Beans Android Task

Homework exercise for candidates.

## Instructions

Please work towards building a simple app with the following acceptance criteria. 
Please complete as many as you can, and feel free to add anything that will help you demonstrate advanced knowledge.
Make sure you clone the repository and send us a compressed package (zip) of your solution.

### Core Focus Areas:

UI: Use Jetpack Compose exclusively for the entire user interface.

Architecture: Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.

Best Practices: Focus on Clean Architecture principles (e.g., clear separation of concerns, use of Usecases/Interactors is encouraged).

Modern Libraries: Leverage the latest stable AndroidX and Jetpack libraries.

### Technical Requirements & Screens

1. Login Screen

Design: Implement a clean, responsive login screen using Compose.

Validation:

On tapping "Log in", validate that both fields (Username/Email and Password) are not empty.

Show inline, user-friendly error messages below the input fields if validation fails.

Navigation: Upon successful validation, navigate to the Photos Screen.

2. Photos Screen

API Source: Display data from https://dummyjson.com/products?select=id,title,thumbnail

List Implementation: Use a Lazy Column or Lazy Vertical Grid in Compose to display the data efficiently.

Item Display: Each item must clearly show:

- The image from the thumbnail. Use a dedicated Compose image loading library (like Coil or Glide/Accompanist) for this.

- The title.

Filtering/Search 🔍

Add a search bar at the top of the screen.

The list must dynamically filter in real-time as the user types, matching against the title field. Bonus points for debounce implementation to optimize API or list filtering calls.


State Handling & Loading 🔄

Implement and visually show Loading (e.g., a CircularProgressIndicator) while the API request is in flight.

Implement robust Error Handling (e.g., a Snackbar or a persistent error message with a "Retry" button) for network or API errors.
